						<strong>Once Upon A Game aka OUAG, is an interactive website born from a school project which tells the story of the Olympic Games from a socio-political point of view.</strong>
						<p>Through several milestones such as the Games of Antwerp (1920), Berlin (1936), Melbourne (1956), Moscow (1980), Mexico (1968) or Montreal (1976), we tried to demonstrate the following problem: "How does a sporting event exacerbate and expose tensions within the organizing country and in the world? ".
						In order to achieve this, we carried out a long journalistic work that we transcribed and synthesized while mixing it with a dark graphic aspect.</p>
